You ask specifically about the highlighted piece of code. You seem to want us to answer whether that section of code causes the specific problem seen.    If the highlighted code has other problems we should ignore that? If we know where the problem is and it is not in the highlighted region should we cite that as our explanation or do you want our answer to be justified by the highlighted code. For example; provide an explanation why the highlighted code can't be causing the problems seen.    I spotted the error almost immediately but it took me a while to figure out what to say in terms of explanation because the error wasn't in the highlighted section. With no examples I really had to guess at the type of feedback you wanted. Some examples of code with errors documented would go a long way in clarifying this task and would make it much easier.    It really is unclear if your goal is to find the error and the highlighted code is just a suggesting of where to start looking or if you want people to give reasons why the highlighted code may or may not be the problem. The first case might represent a situation where you are simply trying to judge how effective or harmful suggestions are in finding errors. Do false positives cause fewer error to be detected? The latter case may be geared towards collecting data to improve automated debugging tools. The feedback could be used to build models that rate the probability a certain section of code is causing the error. Then again you could have a different purpose entirely. I suspect though that a few examples would greatly improve the quality of response you receive.    Thank you.",

For all three I answered; 'Yes; there is an issue' because this was true; there was an issue with the code; but it was only with line 279. I apologize for my misunderstanding but I just wanted to be sure it was clear that I did not realize I would be asked about the same code for the remaining two questions until after I had already answered fully the first question where I explained about what was wrong overall with the code. Once again; apologies for my confusion. The task was rather straight forward and simple. I just tend to overthink when asked simple questions. (Just like the question about 'return i' versus 'top=....[i];' because I was unsure if return top was kept or not out of the brackets; but I assumed it was not and I was only being asked about what was returned within the method brackets. I believe this was on question 4 of the introductory questions.)",
