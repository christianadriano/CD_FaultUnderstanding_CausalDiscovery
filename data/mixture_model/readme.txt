this data was produced by the project EM_GaussianMixtureModel_TaskDurations, 
more specifically the file EM_TestDuration_E2.R

The data corresponds to a categorization of subjects in either two groups 
according to how fast they answered the qualification test.

The columns with the information is named testDuration_fastMembership and isFast.
testDuration_fastMembership contains the probability rate (between 0 and 1) of the corresponding subject being a member of the fast group
isFast is a boolean value, if (testDuration_fastMembership>50%) then TRUE, else FALSE

Analysis of these results are in the project folder EM_GaussianMixtureModel_TaskDurations\output
and in the inline comments in the script EM_TestDuration_E2.R
