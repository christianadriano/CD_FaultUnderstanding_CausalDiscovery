Comparative Study of the Outcomes of Traditional Outlier Detection Methods

Goal(Goal-Base Question Metric):

What: Compare the outcomes of different outlier detection methods
Why-1: mitigate wrong outlier detection might lead incorrect understanding of the data (construct validity threat)
why-2: increase the reproducibility of the data wrangling procedure
How: Traditional outlier detection methods (Boxplot, MAD, Adjusted Boxplot)
Data: Crowdsourced answers from programmers about location of software faults


Gist of results:
Method M1 produced was prefered for dataset D1 because .....
